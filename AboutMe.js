              Hello! My name is Abdullah and I enjoy creating things that live
              on the internet. My interest in web development started back in
              2020 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns
              out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about
              HTML & CSS! Fast-forward to today. My main focus these days is
              building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
              Upstatement for a variety of clients.
